# XTend_FSSH

Extends a series of FSSH trajectories for a dissociating tri-atomic using a harmonic approximation
for the fragment vibrational motion. Requires geometry array and a vector labelling the dissociating atom.

Wave centre, amplitude, frequency and phase shift calculated from either the last two peaks
or troughs of the oscillating fragment. The peak or trough with the smallest difference between
the last two peaks/troughs is used as the basis of extension.  

Inspect the extension using the plotting options.
